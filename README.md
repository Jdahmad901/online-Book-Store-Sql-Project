Online Book Store – SQL Database Project

Designed and implemented a relational database system for an Online Book Store using SQL. This project demonstrates my understanding of core database concepts including table creation, data manipulation, and query writing.

✅ Created and populated multiple interconnected tables such as books, customers, orders, and categories
✅ Solved 10 basic SQL queries involving SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY
✅ Solved 9 advanced SQL queries focusing on subqueries, aggregate functions, nested queries, and data insights
✅ Ensured data normalization and integrity through use of proper keys and constraints

This project enhanced my skills in SQL query optimization and database design — preparing me for real-world data handling and analysis tasks.
